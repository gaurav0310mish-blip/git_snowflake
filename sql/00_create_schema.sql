-- Create schema/user if needed (optional – adjust for your environment)
-- In many ADW setups, the user/schema already exists.
-- This is just an example.

-- CREATE USER adw_user IDENTIFIED BY "password"
--   DEFAULT TABLESPACE data
--   TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
--   QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;

-- GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO adw_user;
-- GRANT DWROLE TO adw_user;

-- Run this as ADMIN or a privileged user if you need to create the schema.
